# 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps – Zepto SQL Analysis

Before performing business analysis, the dataset was validated and cleaned to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## 1. Null Value Check
- Checked all columns for NULL values.
- Ensured product name is NOT NULL (as defined in schema).

## 2. Duplicate Product Names
- Identified products where the same name appeared multiple times.
- Verified whether duplicates were valid SKUs or data issues.

## 3. Zero Price Validation
- Found products where MRP = 0 or Selling Price = 0.
- Removed rows where MRP = 0 to avoid skewed analysis.

## 4. Currency Standardization
- Prices were originally in paise.
- Converted MRP and discountSellingPrice from paise to rupees.

## 5. Stock Validation
- Verified OutOfStock boolean values.
- Checked availableQuantity consistency.

## 6. Weight Consistency
- Ensured weightInGms values were realistic.
- Used weight for segmentation and price-per-gram calculation.

These cleaning steps ensured accurate revenue estimation and discount analysis.
